My motivation for learning is my natural curiosity; I love learning for the sake of learning. I always ask myself "how does that work exactly" when I observe a complex concept or task - this relates directly to coding. I also wish to pursue a career in programming, since I've been fascinated with technology in general ever since I was a kid.
